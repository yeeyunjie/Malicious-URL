Identifying Unsafe Websites
---

## Executive Summary
---
In an attempt to steal data from users, bad actors would use 'lookalikes'/phishing sites to bait users. 
Thus, I aim to build model that warns users on the likelihood of a harmful website before clicking on them. 
Catboost would be my algorithm of choice given its comparatively shorter runtime and lower tendency to overfit.

### Problem Statement
---
The rise in cybercrimes has been alarming and one of the contributers would be the phishing campaigns. Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly complex and
these make up almost twice as many incidents as compared to other cybercrimes. They are made to trick users by disguising as legitimate sites to steal users' sensitive information.
Therefore, it is important that we have tools to help us make well-informed decisions before clicking on sites
